 ## House Price Prediction Using Random Forest Regression
I. Overview

This project predicts house prices using a Random Forest Regressor model trained on the Kaggle House Prices dataset
 (or a similar dataset).
The model uses numerical features from the dataset to predict the SalePrice of each house, offering a simple yet powerful machine learning pipeline built with Python and scikit-learn.

II. Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and handle missing values.

- Train a Random Forest Regression model for price prediction.

- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.

- Visualize predicted vs. actual prices for model interpretation.

III. Technologies Used

. Python

. Jupyter Notebook

. Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing

. Numpy – Numerical computations

. Matplotlib – Data visualization

. Scikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluation

IV. Model Evaluation

The notebook computes:

. R² Score – Measures model accuracy (closer to 1 means better fit)

. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) – Average difference between predicted and actual prices

. Additionally, a scatter plot of predicted vs. actual prices helps visualize model performance.

V. Possible Improvements

- Incorporate categorical feature encoding (OneHotEncoder or LabelEncoder).

- Use feature selection or dimensionality reduction to improve performance.

- Try hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV).

- Experiment with Gradient Boosting or XGBoost for comparison.
